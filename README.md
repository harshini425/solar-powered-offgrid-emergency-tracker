# solar-powered-offgrid-emergency-tracker
A solar-powered embedded wearable device designed for emergency location tracking in off-grid environments. The system uses GNSS for positioning and LoRa communication for long-range, low-power data transmission. Designed and validated through simulation with a focus on low-power and autonomous operation.

## Overview
A solar-powered embedded wearable device designed for emergency location tracking in off-grid environments.  
The system uses GNSS for positioning and LoRa communication for long-range, low-power data transmission.  
Designed and validated through simulation with a focus on low-power and autonomous operation.
